<h2>The Elden Leaf: A Tale of Salad in the Lands Between</h2>
<p><b>In the shadowed corners of the Lands Between, where the Erdleaf sprouts and ancient castles crumble into dust, there existed a once-vibrant kingdom known as Greenshade.<br>It's people worshipped the Great Garnish, a divine relic said to be the source of all vitality and flavor in the world.<br> The Great Garnish, an eternal, shimmering lettuce leaf, was said to be plucked from the hands of the Salad Elden, a god of taste and balance.<br>
    But as with all things in the Lands Between, peace was not eternal.<br> The Fracture of Dressing, a cataclysmic event caused by the Great Garnish's corruption, split Greenshade into warring factions, each claiming their own right to wield the power of the Great Salad Bowl.<br>Chaos ensued. The balance of crunch, zest, and dressing was forever lost.</b></p>

<h2 class="autoShow">The Garnished Leafbearer</h2>
<p class="autoShow"><b>You are Garnished, a lowly wanderer, exiled from the glory of Greenshade.<br> You awaken in the Field of Wilt, surrounded by rotting lettuce and shattered croutons.<br> A faint glow pierces through the mists-a light guiding you toward the forgotten Shrine of the Elden Dressing, where the secrets of the Great Garnish may yet linger.<br>
    A voice calls to you. It is Chef Oloric, a spectral figure draped in aprons of tarnished gold.<br> His eyes are weary, but his voice is steady.
    “Tarnished Leafbearer, long have you slumbered. The balance of salad has been lost.<br> The Thousand Bowls of Greenshade are drenched in chaos—some overdressed, others dry and barren. You must journey to restore the Great Garnish and reclaim the title of Leaflord.”<br>
    Oloric fades, leaving behind only his rusted ladle-a humble weapon, yet one destined for greatness.</b></p>

    <h2 class="custom-header-2">Crouton Order:</h2>
<p><b>Knights encased in armor made of hardened bread, they value crunch above all else...<br> They view softness as weakness and have banned all leafy greens from their lands.</b></p>

<h2 class="custom-header-2">Dressing Coven:</h2>
<p><b>Sorcerers obsessed with perfect emulsions, they flood their territory with rivers of ranch and vinaigrette.<br> Their power is overwhelming but corrupt, drowning all life beneath waves of overpowering flavor.</b></p>

<h2 class="custom-header-2">Bitter Greens:</h2>
<p><b>Rebels who worship the purity of raw leaves-arugula,<br> kale, and endive. They scorn the indulgence of dressings or toppings, considering them heresy.</b></p>

<h2 class="custom-header-2">The Fruitmongers:</h2>
<p><b>Mad prophets who toss forbidden fruits-mangoes, strawberries, and oranges-into their bowls, defying tradition.<br> Their lands are sweet but perilous, for their twisted creations are both alluring and deadly.</b></p>
